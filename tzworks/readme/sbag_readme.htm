<hr/><!---------------------About the <b><i>sbag</i></b> Tool---------------------->
<h2><a name="about">About the <i>sbag</i> Tool</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p><b><i>sbag</i></b> is a command line version of 
a Windows registry parser that targets the Shellbag subkeys to pull useful 
directory and file artifacts to help identify user activity.  There are 
binaries available for Windows, Linux and Mac OS-X.  The Windows version 
allows one to parse hives resident from a live system. </p>

<p>As background, the ShellBag information is a set of subkeys in a user registry 
hive (eg. <i>ntuser.dat</i> and <i>usrclass.dat</i> files) used by the Windows 
operating system to track user window viewing preferences.  It does this by 
storing various Windows Explorer settings that relates to dimensions, settings, 
etc. This allows one to reopen the same folder at a later time with the settings 
from the previous time.  Each user will have separate preferences for folders, 
and therefore, these settings are stored in the appropriate user hive.</p>

<p>Since the ShellBag subkeys store various metadata on how Windows Explorer items 
were arranged, and since they are recorded for each user, from a computer forensics 
standpoint, one can parse the data and pull out various pieces of information that 
relate to user interaction. When combined with other available computer artifacts, 
it could provide a more complete picture of what files were accessed or deleted by 
the user and from what storage device they were accessing (could be either an internal, 
external or network storage device). The <i>'ShellNoRoam\BagXxx'</i> key(s) has data for 
local folders and the <i>'Shell\BagXxx'</i> key(s) has data for the remote folders.</p>

<p>The registry subkeys that <b><i>sbag</i></b> evaluates include the following::</p>

<ul>
    <li>NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\BagMRU</li>
    <li>NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\Bags</li>
    <li>NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\ShellNoRoam\BagMRU</li>
    <li>NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\ShellNoRoam\Bags</li>
    <li>UsrClass.DAT\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\BagMRU</li>
    <li>UsrClass.DAT\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\Bags</li>
    <li>UsrClass.DAT\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\ShellNoRoam\BagMRU</li>
    <li>UsrClass.DAT\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\ShellNoRoam\Bags</li>
</ul>

<p>On Vista and Windows 7, the UsrClass hive is new and is located in the
C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows directory.</p>
        
<p>To use this tool, an authentication file is required to be in the same 
directory as the binary for the tool to run.  The non-commercial/demonstrational-use 
EULA is part of this readme. It only activates certain capabilities of the 
tool and is meant only for demonstration purposes.  This authentication will 
eventually expire.  To activate all the functionality of the tool and use 
it on a permanent basis, a separate business license needs to be purchased. 
Contact <a href="mailto:info@tzworks.net">info&#64;tzworks.net</a> for more 
details about the using this tool for business and/or casework use.</p>

<hr/><!---------------------How to use sbag---------------------->
<h2><a name="howto">How to use <i>sbag</i></a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p><b><i>sbag</i></b> is a console application, and thus, to use use this tool 
on a live system, one will need to open the command prompt with administrator 
privileges first.  One can display the menu options by typing in the executable name 
with no parameters.  While the menu shows a number of different options, the 
only required parameter to pass in is the user hive one wishes to extract 
shellbag artifacts from.  The available options include: (a) annotating username and/or 
hostname to the output (version 0.23+), (b) specifying what type of format one wishes to 
put the output data in, and (c) whether to extract data from cell slack space 
(version 0.24+).</p>

<p>The output options include: (a) the default output, where each record is 
on a separate line and each field is separated by the pipe character, (b) the 
SleuthKit body-file format [5] and (c) the log2timeline CSV (comma separated 
value) format. [6] </p>

<p>Below is the menu with the various options.  Details of each option can be found 
<a href="#options">here</a>.</p>

<pre>
    sbag - full ver: 0.37; Copyright (c) TZWorks LLC

    Usage:
     (note: options with ** are enabled with a commercial license)

      sbag64 &lt;user hive&gt; [format options]
      sbag64 &lt;hive&gt; &gt; out.txt    = redirect output to a file
      dir &lt;somedir&gt;\*ntuser* /b /s [/a:h] | sbag64 -pipe &gt; out.txt = using a pipe
      sbag64 -livehives          = list user hives available
 
     Basic options
      -csv                   = output in comma separated value format
      -csvl2t                = log2timeline output [needs validation]
      -bodyfile              = sleuthkit output [needs validation]
      -base10                = use base10 for file size instead of hex
      -userstats             = pull acct from hive [ntuser.dat only]
      -username &lt;name&gt;       = output will contain this username
      -hostname &lt;name&gt;       = output will contain this hostname
 
     Additional options
      -inc_slack             = ** include slack data in parse
      -dateformat yyyy/mm/dd = ** "mm/dd/yyyy" is the default
      -timeformat hh:mm:ss   = ** "hh:mm:ss.xxx" is the default
      -no_whitespace         = ** remove whitespace between csv delimiter
      -csv_separator "|"     = ** use a pipe char for separator
      -pipe                  = ** pipe user hives into sbag for processing
</pre>

<p>Below is an example syntax of parsing a user hive in an off-line manner. For 
this example, it assumes a user hive was extracted to the c:\dump directory 
beforehand.  To parse the hive, one could then invoke the following command:</p>
 <pre>
        <b><i>sbag</i></b> c:\dump\ntuser.dat &gt; results.txt
</pre>

<p>Since the output that is generated is very wide, it is recommended that 
one redirect the output of the command into a results file as show above.  
Then it can be reviewed in any text editor by turning off the word wrap 
option to see each record on a separate line.   If one wants to take 
advantage of the Comma Separate Value (CSV) format that is easily opened 
with any spreadsheet application, one could use the <b>-csv</b> option, like below:</p>
<pre>
        <b><i>sbag</i></b> c:\dump\ntuser.dat -csv &gt; results.csv
</pre>

<p>The only difference in the results between the normal output and the 
CSV output is the CSV processed output is checked for any occurrences of 
commas.  If any commas are found, they are changed into semicolons so as to not disrupt the
CSV format for separating the fields.  Thus, if one needs exact data 
without any possible modifications, one should choose the normal 
(default) output.  The normal (default) output uses the pipe character 
'|' for a delimiter which does not conflict with any valid Windows filename syntax.</p>   

<p>For processing shellbag artifacts on a live system, one can use the 
<b>-livehives</b> option to enumerate the available hives that <b><i>sbag</i></b> can process.</p>

<p>Once the path of the location of the user hives are known, one can parse 
any of the desired hives by passing in the path of the active hive.  For this type of live 
processing, <b><i>sbag</i></b> will take care of taking a snapshot of the requested hive 
by reading the appropriate raw NTFS clusters and then proceed to extract 
the artifacts from the snapshot.</p>

<p>For cases where there is sufficient slack space available in the registry cell value 
data, <b><i>sbag</i></b> will try to parse this data into some intelligible output.   Since this option 
is still experiment, it has been added as a separate option one can invoke.   This allows 
one to isolate the option should it exhibit any instability, until sufficient testing has 
been done.  To use this option use the <b>-inc_slack</b> switch.</p>
</div>

<hr/><!---------------------Output Formats Supported---------------------->
<h2><a name="output">Output Formats Supported (and assumptions thereof)</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<ol>
    <li>The default output format is using a pipe '|' separator.  This allows
    commas to be used in filenames and still have a unique separator.</li>

    <li>The <b>-csv</b> option outputs the data fields delimited by commas.  Since filenames
    can have commas, to ensure the fields are uniquely separated, any commas in the
    filenames get converted to semicolons.</li>

    <li>The <b>-bodyfile</b> option outputs the data fields in accordance with the 
    'body-file' version3 specified in the SleuthKit. The date/timestamp outputted
    to the body-file are in terms of UTC.  So if using the body-file in conjunction
    with the mactime.pl utility, one needs to set the environment variable TZ=UTC.
    <b><i>sbag</i></b> has 4 timestamps in the output: access, create, modify times
    and the registry key time.  The first three are put into the appropriate
    body-file time slots, whereas the registry key time is placed in the change time
    body-file time slot.</li>

    <li>The <b>-csvl2t</b> option outputs the data fields in accordance with the 
    log2timeline tool [still needs to be verified].</li>
</ol>
</div>

<hr/><!---------------------Dissecting the output fields---------------------->
<h2><a name="dissecting_output">Dissecting the output fields</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>There are a number of timestamps displayed in the output.  Since the data resides 
in the user's registry hives (ntuser.dat and usrclass.dat), the parent registry 
subkey timestamp of the bag or <i>BagMRU</i> entry is displayed along with a 
modify/access/create timestamp that is pulled from the DOS timestamp of the ItemID 
List (or IDList).  For some of the IDList's the DOS timestamp is not present, and for 
those cases, a blank entry is displayed. </p>

<p>Since the IDList has additional metadata about the target folder or file it references,
it may contain the MFT entry (inode) and sequence number of the target.  If present,
<b><i>sbag</i></b> displays them in their own respective columns.  One should note, however,
if the sequence number is zero, one can interpret the target folder or file 
as residing on a non-NTFS partition, since the zero is an invalid sequence number.</p>

<p>When available, the size of the target file is displayed.  This is most commonly
populated with the <i>Bags ItemPos</i> parse rather than the <i>BagMRU</i> parse.</p>

<p>A Most Recently Used (MRU) indicator is displayed in the output for <i>BagMRU</i> entries
to clearly show which registry subkey timestamp relates to the IDList entry</p>

<p>There is a column that identifies the source registry subkey and value name used.
This was provided to allow an analyst to easily track where the entry was parsed from
and therefore allow for independent verification of the results.</p>

<p>Starting with version 0.35, is a new column in the output that contains related 
<i>Bags</i> subkey timestamps that are associated with the IDList in the <i>BagMRU</i> hierarchy.
These additional timestamps are useful, in combination with the <i>BagMRU</i> timestamps
to give more insight to those entries that did not have a MRU indicator and when
they were last updated.</p>

<p>Finally, a new metadata column was added with version 0.35 to account for additional
data parsed from various devices.  For portable devices, there is a wealth of information
that is embedded, so this additional information is outputted in the metadata column.</p>

<h2><a name="auth">Authentication and License File</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>This tool has authentication built into the binary.  There are two authentication 
mechanisms:  
(a) the digital certificate embedded into the binary and (b) the runtime authentication.   
For the first method, only the Windows and Mac OS-X (if available) versions have been 
signed by an X-509 digital code signing certificate, which is validated by Windows 
(or OS-X) during operation.  If the binary has been tampered with, the digital 
certificate will be invalidated.</p>

<p>For the second (runtime authentication) method, the authentication does two things: 
(a) validates that the tool has a valid license and (b) validates the 
tool's binary has not been corrupted.   The license needs to be in the same directory 
of the tool for it to authenticate.   Furthermore any modification to the license, 
either to its name or contents, will invalidate the license.   The runtime binary 
validation hashes the executable that is running and fails the authentication if it 
detects any modifications. </p>

<h4><i>Limited</i> vice <i>Full</i> in the tool's output banner</h4>

<p>The tools from TZWorks tools will output header information about the tool's version
and whether it is running in <i>limited</i> or <i>full</i> mode.  This is directly related
to what version of a license the tool authenticates with.   The <i>limited</i> keyword 
indicates some functionality of the tool is not available, and the <i>full</i> keyword 
indicates all the functionality is available.  The lacking functionality in the <i>limited</i>
version may mean one or all of the following: (a) certain options may not be available, 
(b) certain data may not be outputted in the parsed results, and (c) the license has a 
finite lifetime before expiring.</p>
