<hr/><!---------------------About the <b><i>pf</i></b> Tool---------------------->
<h2><a name="about">About the <b><i>pf</i></b> Tool</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p><b><i>pf</i></b> is a command line version Windows prefetch parser.  Originally inspired by 
the chapter on 'prefetch analysis' as well as the perl script sample given 
in the book on "Windows Forensic Analysis" by Harlan Carvey [1], <b><i>pf</i></b> was 
another tool created for eventual inclusion into a computer forensic toolkit.</p> 

<p>From Wikipedia, "the prefetcher is a component of versions of Microsoft Windows 
starting with Windows XP... that speeds up the Windows boot process, and 
shortens the amount of time it takes to start up programs.  In Windows Vista, 
SuperFetch and ReadyBoost extend upon the prefetcher and attempt to accelerate 
application and boot launch times..."[3]</p>

<p>A good source for a discussion on the internals of the mechanics of prefetching 
is given in the MSDN article written by Mark Russinovich and David Solomon [2].</p>

<p>The prefetcher behavior is controlled by the Windows registry entry:
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session\Manager\Memory 
Management\PrefetchParameters. The value for "EnablePrefetcher" can have one 
of the following values [3]:</p>
<pre>
    0 - Disabled
    1 - Application launch prefetching enabled
    2 - Boot prefetching enabled
    3 - Application launch and boot enabled (default)
</pre>

<p>Based on various references, Windows maintains the prefetch folder up to 128 
entries.</p>

<p>To use this tool, an authentication file is required to be in the same 
directory as the binary for the tool to run.  The non-commercial/demonstrational-use 
EULA is part of this readme. It only activates certain capabilities of the 
tool and is meant only for demonstration purposes.  This authentication will 
eventually expire.  To activate all the functionality of the tool and use 
it on a permanent basis, a separate business license needs to be purchased. 
Contact <a href="mailto:info@tzworks.net">info&#64;tzworks.net</a> for more 
details about the using this tool for business and/or casework use.</p>

</div>

<hr/><!---------------------How to use this tool---------------------->
<h2><a name="howto">How to use this tool</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>Since <b><i>pf</i></b> is a command line tool, one will need to open the command
prompt.  If trying to access the prefetch (%systemroot%\prefetch) folder while running
Vista or beyond, one needs to be running with admin privileges.</p>

<p>Below is the menu with the various options.  Details of each option can be found 
<a href="#options">here</a>.</p>
 
<pre>
    pf - full ver: 1.04; Copyright (c) TZWorks LLC

    Usage:
     (note: options with ** are enabled with a commercial license)

       pf64 &lt;filename&gt; [-csv] [-v]
       dir c:\windows\prefetch\*.pf /b /s | pf64 -pipe [-v] &gt; results.txt

     Basic options
      -csv                   = output in comma separated value format
      -csvl2t                = log2timeline output [needs validation]
      -bodyfile              = sleuthkit output [needs validation]
      -hostname &lt;name&gt;       = output will contain this hostname
      -pipe                  = pipe files into app for processing

     Additional options
      -dateformat yyyy/mm/dd = ** "mm/dd/yy" is the default
      -timeformat hh:mm:ss   = ** "hh:mm:ss.xxx" is the default
      -no_whitespace         = ** remove whitespace between csv delimiter
      -csv_separator "|"     = ** use a pipe character for csv separator
      -pf_path               = ** include prefetch path in output
</pre>

<p>There are 3 output formats: (1) default, which uses one line
per prefetch file parsed and uses pipe delimiters with appropriate
spaces to align columns, (2) [-csv] output, which uses comma separated value
format which is good to view in excel and (3) [-v] verbose format, which uses
multiple lines per prefetch file.  The default format and the verbose 
format are useful to view the output in any text editor, while the 
CSV format is useful to view in Microsoft Excel or other spreadsheet 
application.</p>

<p>One can pipe 'path\filename' of the prefetch files into <b><i>pf</i></b> using the [-pipe] switch.  
To use this option one needs to ensure the absolute path is given.  This can be done with the
use of the <b><i>dir</i></b> command by using the switches <b><i>/b /s</i></b>.  
Then one can redirect the output of <b><i>pf</i></b> to a file.  See the
example below for the use of the <b><i>dir</i></b> command:</p>
<pre>
    dir &lt;some directory path&gt; /b /s
</pre>


<p>Typical usage win32 examples include: </p>
<pre>
    To parse individual prefetch files, use:
      pf  &lt;path\prefetch file&gt;                            = default output
      pf -v &lt;path\prefetch file&gt;                          = verbose output

    To parse all prefetch files in a directory, use the [-pipe] switch, eg:
      dir c:\windows\prefetch\*.pf /b /s | pf -pipe       = default output
      dir c:\windows\prefetch\*.pf /b /s | pf -pipe -csv  = verbose output

    To redirect output of pf into a file
      dir c:\windows\prefetch\*.pf /b /s | pf -pipe  &gt; output.txt
      dir c:\windows\prefetch\*.pf /b /s | pf -pipe -csv&gt; output.csv
</pre>

<p>Typical usage linux examples include (assuming the windows prefetch
  files were copied to your local linux directory): </p>
<pre>
    To parse individual prefetch files, use:
      ./pf &lt;path/prefetch file&gt;                          = minimal output
      ./pf -v &lt;path/prefetch file&gt;                       = verbose output

    To parse all prefetch files in a directory, use the [-pipe] switch, eg: 
      ls /home/Prefetch/*.pf | ./pf -pipe                = default output
      ls /home/Prefetch/*.pf | ./pf -pipe -csv           = csv output

    To redirect output of pf into a file
      ls /home/Prefetch/*.pf | ./pf -pipe &gt; output.txt 
      ls /home/Prefetch/*.pf | ./pf -pipe -csv &gt; output.csv
</pre>

<hr/><!---------------------Known Issues---------------------->
<h2><a name="issues">Known Issues</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>
<div>
<p>When using a spreadsheet application (such as Microsoft Excel) to view the output
of CSV type results, sometimes the cell data will wrap.  This is because a cell in the spreadsheet
has a maximum number of characters it can handle.  Typically this is 1024 characters for the
newer spreadsheet applications.   Therefore, when parsing very large prefetch files, the
number of modules loaded by an application can be large and consequently will have an output
of greater than 1024 characters for a module list.  When this happens the data will be
rendered on multiple cells/lines.</p>

        restrictions with this option is a the colon (:) symbol needs to separate hours, minutes 
        and seconds, a period (.) symbol needs to separate the seconds and fractional seconds, and the 
        repeating symbol 'x' to represent number of fractional seconds. (note: the the fractional 
        seconds applies only to those time formats that have the appropriate precision available. 
        The Windows internal filetime has, for example, 100 nsec unit precision available. 
        The DOS time format and the UNIX 'time_t' format, however, have no fractional seconds). 
        Some of the times represented by for this tool may use a time format without fractional 
        seconds and therefore will not show a greater precision beyond seconds when using this

<hr/><!---------------------Authentication and License File---------------------->
<h2><a name="auth">Authentication and License File</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>This tool has authentication built into the binary.  There are two authentication 
mechanisms:  
(a) the digital certificate embedded into the binary and (b) the runtime authentication.   
For the first method, only the Windows and Mac OS-X (if available) versions have been 
signed by an X-509 digital code signing certificate, which is validated by Windows 
(or OS-X) during operation.  If the binary has been tampered with, the digital 
certificate will be invalidated.</p>

<p>For the second (runtime authentication) method, the authentication does two things: 
(a) validates that the tool has a valid license and (b) validates the 
tool's binary has not been corrupted.   The license needs to be in the same directory 
of the tool for it to authenticate.   Furthermore any modification to the license, 
either to its name or contents, will invalidate the license.   The runtime binary 
validation hashes the executable that is running and fails the authentication if it 
detects any modifications. </p>

<h4><i>Limited</i> vice <i>Full</i> in the tool's output banner</h4>

<p>The tools from TZWorks tools will output header information about the tool's version
and whether it is running in <i>limited</i> or <i>full</i> mode.  This is directly related
to what version of a license the tool authenticates with.   The <i>limited</i> keyword 
indicates some functionality of the tool is not available, and the <i>full</i> keyword 
indicates all the functionality is available.  The lacking functionality in the <i>limited</i>
version may mean one or all of the following: (a) certain options may not be available, 
(b) certain data may not be outputted in the parsed results, and (c) the license has a 
finite lifetime before expiring.</p>
