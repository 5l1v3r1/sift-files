<hr/><!---------------------About the <b><i>evtx_view</i></b> Tool---------------------->
<h2><a name="about">About the <b><i>evtx_view</i></b> Tool
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p><b><i>evtx_view</i></b> is a GUI version of an event log viewer that can parse 
Windows event logs from all versions of Windows starting with Windows XP.  This 
includes Vista, Windows 7 and 8 and their server counter parts.  Originally 
inspired by the paper by Andreas Schuster on 'Introducing the Microsoft 
Vista event log format', evtx_view was an attempt to take the concepts 
introduced in the paper and implement a Windows API independent parsing engine. 
Written entirely in C++, the <b><i>evtx_view</i></b> parse engine has been ported
over to Windows, Linux and Mac OS-X.</p>

<p>While Schuster's paper described the key elements of the new Microsoft event 
log file format in  Vista and Windows 7,  his paper included notes on the 
proprietary binary encoding of XML. Further research was necessary, however, to
fully breakout the binary XML structures used in the Windows Vista and beyond.
<b><i>evtx_view</i></b> is a culmination of this research.  Under the hood,
<b><i>evtx_view</i></b> uses the same event log parsing engine as 
<b><i><a href="http://tzworks.net/prototype_page.php?proto_id=25">evtwalk</a></i></b>.</p>

<p><b><i>evtx_view</i></b> also makes use of the <a href="http://www.fox-toolkit.org/">FOX-toolkit </a>.
FOX is a C++ based Toolkit for developing GUI applications that can
easily run across various platforms by compiling the source for the 
appropriate OS.  FOX is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public 
License (LGPL), with a FOX Library License addendum.</p>

<p>To use this tool, an authentication file is required to be in the same 
directory as the binary for the tool to run.  The non-commercial/demonstrational-use 
EULA is part of this readme. It only activates certain capabilities of the 
tool and is meant only for demonstration purposes.  This authentication will 
eventually expire.  To activate all the functionality of the tool and use 
it on a permanent basis, a separate business license needs to be purchased. 
Contact <a href="mailto:info@tzworks.net">info&#64;tzworks.net</a> for more 
details about the using this tool for business and/or casework use.</p>
</div>

<hr/><!---------------------How to use this Tool---------------------->
<h2><a name="howto">How to use this Tool
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>

<p>From the File-&gt;Open menu, select a WinXP, Vista or Windows 7 event log file 
and the structure of the event log will be displayed.</p>

<p>The WinXP eventlogs reside at:</p>
<pre>
    %windir%\system32\config\[AppEvent.Evt | SecEvent.Evt | SysEvent.Evt]
</pre>

<p>The Vista/Win7 eventlogs reside at:</p>
<pre>
    %windir%\system32\winevt\logs\[Application.evtx | Security.evtx | System.evtx | ...]
</pre>

<p>The display is broken up into a tree view directory structure on the
left.  This contains all the records of the selected eventlog.  On the
opposite pane on the right is for displaying output of selected 
records as well as any results of reports/filters.</p>

<p>Geared towards examining the eventlog internals, the tree view
is broken into chunks (for evtx logs) and the encapsulation of each
chunk as it is stored within the actual log. Expanding these folders 
one can see the collection of strings, templates, and records.  For
the evt logs (or WinXP), the internal structure of the logs is much
simpler and hence is displayed just by record.</p>

<p>Incorporated in version 0.62 and beyond is the ability to filter the
log data by event id, date, and/or strings that are contained in the
events.  This filtering is available in the 'Filters menu'. </p>  

<p>While evtx_view is a GUI based tool, it can parse custom scripts to parse 
any desired combination of eventlogs.  This is located in the 'Reports
menu'. The syntax for the custom scripts are described under 'user
defined templates'.</p>

<p>As we have more time, custom 'canned' scripts will be hardcoded into
evtx_view.  An example is the 'user logon/off' script.  If there are
others that are desired, send an email to 
<a href="mailto:info@tzworks.net">info&#64;tzworks.net</a>.</p>
</div>

<hr/><!---------------------User Defined Templates---------------------->
<h2><a name="templates">User Defined Templates
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>

<p>These are text files that allow one to automate eventlog extraction.  The
    parsing rules for these templates are as follows:</p>

<pre>
    General Rules.
        1. each line is parsed separately
        2. a line that starts w/ a double forward slash (eg //) is ignored
            and used for comments
        3. a blank line is ignored
        4. any line not satisfying Rule 2 & 3 above is assumed to be a command.
        5. all command lines are in CSV (comma separated value) format

    Commands lines
        1. must start with the sequence:   !cmd
        2. and contain the following options, CSV delimited (in any order):
            -enum_evtxlog
            -log, &lt;evtx path&gt;
            -id, &lt;event id to extract&gt;
            -name, &lt;event name to use for output&gt;
            -conditions, &lt;parameter name|value name&gt;        .. note: the '|' pipe character separating the name and value
            -pull, &lt;parameter data to extract&gt;
</pre>
           
<h4>Template examples:</h4>

<pre>
    !cmd, -enum_evtxlog, -log, c:\windows\system32\winevt\logs\security.evtx, -id, 4624, -name, logon, -pull, TargetUserSid, -pull, SubjectUserSid, -pull, TargetUserName, -pull, LogonProcessName
    !cmd, -enum_evtxlog, -log, c:\windows\system32\winevt\logs\system.evtx, -id, 1074, -name, reboot or shutdown, -conditions, Data|winlogon.exe

    // for pre-vista (eg. xp) use the following:
    //  for the -pull, use the key word strings to pull all the string data out
    //
    !cmd, -enum_evtlog, -log, c:\windows\system32\config\system.evt, -id, 1074, -name, reboot or shutdown, -pull, strings
</pre>
</div>

<hr/><!---------------------FAQs---------------------->
<h2><a name="faqs">FAQs
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>Network shares and issues w/ running under the admin account.    
Some artifacts  when running under Vista or Windows 7 are the any network shares 
established prior as a regular (non-admin) user, will be isolated from other 
accounts (including the admin account).  This problem occurs because User Account 
Control (UAC) treats members of the Administrators group as standard users. 
Therefore, network shares that are mapped by logon scripts are shared with 
the standard user access token instead of with the full administrator access 
token. </p>

<p>(according to Microsoft - http://support.microsoft.com/kb/937624)
To work around this problem, configure the EnableLinkedConnections registry 
value. This value enables Windows Vista to share network connections between 
the filtered access token and the full administrator access token for a member 
of the Administrators group. After you configure this registry value, LSA 
checks whether there is another access token that is associated with the current 
user session if a network resource is mapped to an access token. If LSA 
determines that there is a linked access token, it adds the network share to 
the linked location. </p>

<p>To configure the EnableLinkedConnections registry value, follow these steps: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Click Start, type regedit in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER</li>
    <li>Locate and then right-click the following registry subkey: <pre>
            HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System</pre></li>

    <li>Point to New, and then click DWORD Value.</li>
    <li>Type EnableLinkedConnections, and then press ENTER.</li>
    <li>Right-click EnableLinkedConnections, and then click Modify.</li>
    <li>In the Value data box, type 1, and then click OK.</li>
    <li>Exit Registry Editor, and then restart the computer.</li>
</ul>
             
<p>Warning: Microsoft does not support this workaround.  They state that
this workaround may make your system unsafe and should only be done at 
your own risk</p>        
</div>

<hr/><!---------------------Authentication and License File---------------------->
<h2><a name="auth">Authentication and License File</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>This tool has authentication built into the binary.  There are two authentication 
mechanisms:  
(a) the digital certificate embedded into the binary and (b) the runtime authentication.   
For the first method, only the Windows and Mac OS-X (if available) versions have been 
signed by an X-509 digital code signing certificate, which is validated by Windows 
(or OS-X) during operation.  If the binary has been tampered with, the digital 
certificate will be invalidated.</p>

<p>For the second (runtime authentication) method, the authentication does two things: 
(a) validates that the tool has a valid license and (b) validates the 
tool's binary has not been corrupted.   The license needs to be in the same directory 
of the tool for it to authenticate.   Furthermore any modification to the license, 
either to its name or contents, will invalidate the license.   The runtime binary 
validation hashes the executable that is running and fails the authentication if it 
detects any modifications. </p>

<h4><i>Limited</i> vice <i>Full</i> in the tool's output banner</h4>

<p>The tools from TZWorks tools will output header information about the tool's version
and whether it is running in <i>limited</i> or <i>full</i> mode.  This is directly related
to what version of a license the tool authenticates with.   The <i>limited</i> keyword 
indicates some functionality of the tool is not available, and the <i>full</i> keyword 
indicates all the functionality is available.  The lacking functionality in the <i>limited</i>
version may mean one or all of the following: (a) certain options may not be available, 
(b) certain data may not be outputted in the parsed results, and (c) the license has a 
finite lifetime before expiring.</p>
