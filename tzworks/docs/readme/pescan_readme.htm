<hr/><!---------------------About the <b><i>pescan</i></b> Tool---------------------->
<h2><a name="about">About the <b><i>pescan</i></b> Tool</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p><b><i>pescan</i></b> is a command line tool to scan portable executable (PE) files to
identify how they were constructed.  Various metadata is displayed, identifying items such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Compile timestamp</li>
    <li>MACB timestamps</li>
    <li>File size and type of executable</li>
    <li>Target OS and whether binary is 32 or 64 bit</li>
    <li>Linker version used</li>
    <li>Entry point address and desired image base address</li>
    <li>Whether an X509 certificate was used and who the author is.</li>
    <li>Whether there is a checksum present and does it match the binary</li>
    <li>An abnormality score which compares the internal construction to normal Windows files from Microsoft.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>pescan</i></b> also has the ability to consume any standard PEiD file
containing signatures and use it during the scanning process. If a PEiD file is
supplied, additional statistics will be displayed based on the PEiD signatures
found.</p>
  
<p>Internally, <b><i>pescan</i></b> uses the same PE libraries that are used
in <b><i>pe_view</i></b> to analyze the PE internals. This allows 
<b><i>pescan</i></b> to be cross platform and hence there are compiled versions 
for Windows, Linux and OS-X, both in 32 and 64 bit binaries.</p>

<p>To use this tool, an authentication file is required to be in the same 
directory as the binary for the tool to run.  The non-commercial/demonstrational-use 
EULA is part of this readme. It only activates certain capabilities of the 
tool and is meant only for demonstration purposes.  This authentication will 
eventually expire.  To activate all the functionality of the tool and use 
it on a permanent basis, a separate business license needs to be purchased. 
Contact <a href="mailto:info@tzworks.net">info&#64;tzworks.net</a> for more 
details about the using this tool for business and/or casework use.</p>

<hr/><!---------------------Usage---------------------->
<h2><a name="usage">Usage</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>One can display the menu options by typing in the executable name 
with no parameters.  Below is the menu with the various options.  Details 
of each option can be found <a href="#options">here</a>.</p>
<pre>
   pescan - full ver: 0.24; Copyright (c) TZWorks LLC
   
   Usage
    (note: options with ** are enabled with a commercial license)
   
     pescan &lt;pefile&gt; [options]
     pescan &lt;pefile&gt; -peid &lt;peid file&gt;  &gt; results.txt
     pescan &lt;pefile&gt; -anomalies &gt; results.txt   = **
     dir *.exe /b /s | pescan -pipe -csv &gt; results.csv
   
    Basic options
     -csv                      = output in comma separated value format
     -hostname &lt;name&gt;          = display hostname in output
     -pipe                     = use stdin to pipe in files to parse
     -out &lt;results file&gt;       = send output to a file
     -peid &lt;peid file&gt;         = use this PEiD file during scan (see readme)
     -base10                   = output in base10 vice hex
     -msg_table                = ** extract any msg tables [not avail w/ -csv]
     -wevt_temp                = ** extract any eventlog templates [not avail w/ -csv]
   
    Additional options
     -dump_entrypt &lt;# bytes&gt;   = ** dump the bytes at entrypoint [up 0x50 bytes]
     -md5                      = ** output MD5 hash of binary
     -sha1                     = ** output SHA1 hash of binary
     -dateformat yyyy/mm/dd    = ** "mm/dd/yyyy" is the default
     -timeformat hh:mm:ss      = ** "hh:mm:ss" is the default
     -no_whitespace            = ** remove whitespace between csv delimiter
     -quiet                    = ** don't display status during run
     -csv_separator "|"        = ** use a pipe char for csv separator
     -anomalies                = ** enum PE attributes differing from norm
     -rating &lt;min rating&gt;      = ** display results for ratings at or above
</pre>

<p>The command line options include:</p>
<pre>
    1. To dump stats of an individual PE file, use:
        pescan &lt;pefile&gt;     

    2. To incorporate output from the PEiD signature type file, 
    use the following option:
        pescan &lt;pefile&gt; -peid &lt;peid file&gt;

    3. To process many PE files, one can pass target files via standard input,
    into <b><i>pescan</i></b>.  To use this option, one needs to specify the '-pipe' option.
    Also there are other various options available when piping in files
    via the std input.  This includes: (a) incorporating a PEiD signature
    file, (b) outputting the results in comma separated value (csv) format,
    (c) specifying an output file.

        &lt;std input&gt; | pescan -pipe [-peid &lt;peid file&gt;] [-csv] [-out &lt;results file&gt;] [-quiet]

    Below is an example of piping in a directory of files into pescan. The output
    will yield a csv file that can be opened in excel or other tool to view csv files.

        For windows:
        dir c:\windows\system32\* /b /s | pescan -pipe -csv -out results.csv

        For Linux or Mac
        find /home -name *.exe -type f | ./pe_view -pipe -csv -out ./results.csv
</pre>

<p>The output shows 2 types of data.  (1) The first type of output are the basic 
stats of the PE file analyzed.  This includes: type of PE file, compile time,
entrypoint rva, imagebase, company name (if present), linker version, minimum 
version of windows required to run, etc.    (2) The second type of output tries 
to infer something about the PE internals.. For example, if one uses PEiD 
signatures, it will try to identify how the PE was compiled or packed.  
Independently it will also try to determine if the construction of the PE file 
looks like something that would warrant offline analysis.  For example, if <b><i>pescan</i></b> 
determined that a file is packed and/or has an embedded executable file inserted 
into one of the sections or if there is a section with high entropy, it will 
state that.   Finally <b><i>pescan</i></b> will come up with a numeric metric to determine 
how abnormal the PE internals are.  Since this metric is subjective and will 
undoubtedly change as more heuristics are drawn upon in future versions, it 
should not be used to infer anything negative about the PE file analyzed. It
only reflects how it compares to most PE files distributed as part of the 
Windows operating system. </p>
</div>

<hr/><!---------------------PEiD Signatures---------------------->
<h2><a name="peid">PEiD Signatures</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>The <a href="#peid_refs">PEiD reference below</a>, has some links to locations where one can obtain a PEiD
signature file or get more information about its format.  Below are the rules
for how <b><i>pescan</i></b> parses PEiD signature files, should you wish to generate your
own signatures.</p>

<pre>
  1. Signature file is a text document

  2. Each line is parsed using the following rules.
    a. The following are keywords or special characters:
        ';'
        '[' ']'
        'signature ='
        'ep_only ='
        '??'

    b. General Rules.
        i.   each line is parsed separately
        ii.  a line that starts w/ a semi-colon ';', then the entire line is ignore
              and used for comments
        iii. a blank line is ignored

    c. The name of the signature in encompassed in square brackets []. The opening
        square bracket should start at the beginning of the line.

    d. The signature is preceded by the keyword 'signature ='.  The signature is 
        represented by hexadecimal bytes where each byte is separated by spaces.  
        Wildcard bytes are represented by '??'

    e. If the signature is meant to be scanned at the PE entrypoint, it will be
        designated as 'ep_only = true'; otherwise if the signature is to be search
        throughout the file contents, it will be designated as 'ep_only = false;

    f. For version this version of pescan, only the signatures that are specified
        as 'ep_only = true' are used.  This was decided for speed purposes.  Later 
        versions may incorporate entire PE scanning.

  3. Below is an example of a signature:

        [Microsoft Visual C++ 8]
        signature = E8 ?? ?? 00 00 E9 ?? ?? FF FF
        ep_only = true
</pre>

        repeating symbol 'x' to represent number of fractional seconds. (note: the the fractional 
        seconds applies only to those time formats that have the appropriate precision available. 
        The Windows internal filetime has, for example, 100 nsec unit precision available. 
        The DOS time format and the UNIX 'time_t' format, however, have no fractional seconds). 
        Some of the times represented by for this tool may use a time format without fractional

<hr/><!---------------------Authentication and License File---------------------->
<h2><a name="auth">Authentication and License File</a>
<font size="2"><a href="#index"> (top) </a></font></h2>

<div>
<p>This tool has authentication built into the binary.  There are two authentication 
mechanisms:  
(a) the digital certificate embedded into the binary and (b) the runtime authentication.   
For the first method, only the Windows and Mac OS-X (if available) versions have been 
signed by an X-509 digital code signing certificate, which is validated by Windows 
(or OS-X) during operation.  If the binary has been tampered with, the digital 
certificate will be invalidated.</p>

<p>For the second (runtime authentication) method, the authentication does two things: 
(a) validates that the tool has a valid license and (b) validates the 
tool's binary has not been corrupted.   The license needs to be in the same directory 
of the tool for it to authenticate.   Furthermore any modification to the license, 
either to its name or contents, will invalidate the license.   The runtime binary 
validation hashes the executable that is running and fails the authentication if it 
detects any modifications. </p>

<h4><i>Limited</i> vice <i>Full</i> in the tool's output banner</h4>

<p>The tools from TZWorks tools will output header information about the tool's version
and whether it is running in <i>limited</i> or <i>full</i> mode.  This is directly related
to what version of a license the tool authenticates with.   The <i>limited</i> keyword 
indicates some functionality of the tool is not available, and the <i>full</i> keyword 
indicates all the functionality is available.  The lacking functionality in the <i>limited</i>
version may mean one or all of the following: (a) certain options may not be available, 
(b) certain data may not be outputted in the parsed results, and (c) the license has a 
finite lifetime before expiring.</p>
