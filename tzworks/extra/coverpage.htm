<h3>TZWorks Distribution Contents</h3>
<p>Selected TZWorks tools are included in the SANS Investigated Forensic Toolkit (SIFT).  These
tools have been updated as of 13 Apr 2014.  This distribution is provided to you with a 
complimentary Demonstration and Testing End User License Agreemnet (EULA) that will expire in 
Feb 2015. Only certain 'limited' capabilities of the tools will be unlocked with this 
<a href="../bin/1cf56b98e15de10_edu_license.htm">EULA</a>.  Since we use the EULA to authenticate 
the tools during runtime, the contents of the EULA should not be modified in any way.  Doing so 
will cause the tools not to authenticate.</p>

<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<p>If you are interested in our tools, periodically check our website at
<a href="https://www.tzworks.net" target="_blank"> https://www.tzworks.net</a> for updates.  
If you wish to use our tools to analyze or extract artifacts when working on a case, please 
consider buying a business/commercial license at 
<a href="https://tzworks.net/store/product_page.php" target="_blank">

The business license purchased will unlock all the functionality of the tool(s) and will 
not expire.</p>
